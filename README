currencygui is a currency converter in python using wxpython to convert between different currencies.
The rates are fetched from www.xe.com .

Warning:
By using this software you agree that I cannot be held responsible for any terms of use you may violate of the xe website, you are fully responsible for this yourself.

(Last time I checked the terms of use it stated that you can download and display their currency information for personal use, which is what this app does)

Requirements:
- Python 2.4 (May work on some older versions, but I only tested it on 2.4 and 2.5)
- wxPython 2.8 (Same story as above)
- A working internet connection

Just run the app by typing 'python currencygui.pyw' or by double-clicking on it.
You can modify the shown currencies in the config.txt .
You are also able to modify the useragent that currencygui shows when connecting to xe .

Todolist:
- Some extra errorcatching
- Maybe a configuration tool in menu for config.txt
- Port to python 3.x
- Do you have any ideas/suggestions? Feel free to contribute, or just tell me by mailing me on info@krisje8.com .
